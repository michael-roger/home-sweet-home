# Home Sweet Home

Home Sweet Home is an application that aims to assist underserved communities in finding inclusive housing that satisfies the needs of each unique individual. 
Buildings and housing units can be sorted based on their amenities so that users can easily filter for their own personal perusal. 
Individual units that users deem most compatible can also be added to a user's "Favorites" for them to return to at a later time.
Our previous iteration did not have the "Favorites" functionality, which now streamlines the process of considering multiple units.
Furthermore, all building features and housing unit features are now displayed, which is also new to this iteration.
This allows users to clearly see the extent of our service and which particular features of a building and unit can be tracked on Home Sweet Home.
