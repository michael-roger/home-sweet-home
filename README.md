# Home-Sweet-Home

The Home Sweet Home Application aims to assist underserved communities in finding inclusive housing that satisfies the needs of each unique individual. Buildings and housing units can be sorted based on their amenities so that users can easily filter for their own personal perusal. Individual units that users deem most compatible can also be added to a user's "Favorites" for them to return to at a later time. All building features and housing unit features are now displayed on the home page. This allows users to clearly see the extent of our service and which particular features of a building and unit can be tracked on Home Sweet Home. All buildings can be seen via the Buildings tab on the navigation bar so that users may easily see all of their building options on one page and browse as desired.

This application retrieves its data from the [KebabCase Affordable and Inclusive Housing Access API](https://github.com/michael-roger/KebabCase).
